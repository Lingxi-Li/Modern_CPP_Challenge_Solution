# My solution to ["The Modern C++ Challenge"][1]

Some notes.
1. I don't bother `constexpr`-specify any function. It's a burden, and not that useful in practice.
2. I don't bother `explicit`-specify any constructor. I like implicit conversion. If bugs are introduced then, it's your fault :/
3. If you see something not nice or inferior to the solution given in the book, please [comment][2]. I think I can explain.
4. Thanks for watching :]
